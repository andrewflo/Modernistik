/**
 A useful Operation subclass that allows for asynchrnous
 actions to be performed before being marked as completed.
 
 To use, you sublcass `ConcurrentOperation`, define override
 `main()` and call `finish()` whenever you want to mark the
 operation as completed.
 
 ## Example
 ````
 public class SampleOperation : ConcurrentOperation {
 
    override open func main() {
 
        //... do some async work.
        async_delay(3) {
 
            // call when done
            self.finish()
        }
    }
 }
 ````
