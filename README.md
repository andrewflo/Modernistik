## Installation
Modernistik is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Modernistik', '~> 0.5' # Swift 5+
pod 'Modernistik', '~> 0.4' # Swift 4.2+
```

## Examples
The core framework has several enhancements and helper methods as Swift extensions to the Swift Standard library, Foundation, CoreGraphics and UIKit. In addition it provides a set of protocols and base components that should be used when creating classes - these are usually prefixed with `Modern`. Most of the methods are documented, so feel free to review the code.

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Examples directory first. To make it easier, you can run the `./setup.sh` script to prepare all examples..
